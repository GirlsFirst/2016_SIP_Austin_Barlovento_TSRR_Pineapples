      <h5><span class="label label-primary">PIZZA</span></h5><br>
      <p>Hey people! It's me, Alice! TODAY WAS INSANE! I went to the store today and I bought
       a box of Pizza Pockets, not the off brand! I was so excited to devour my favorite food
       for lunch when... I opened the box...ANDDD... there was only 1 pocket inside! I was so
       upset! Why would they say that there was 2 ON the box and only 1 IN the <strong>box?!?</strong> I called
       the company and they told me that I would get a free box! I asked them if they meant 2 boxes,
       BUT NOOOO, they just meant 1! How outrageous! I may not even eat from them again! Well I am
       going to go heat up my food!</p>
       <p>See you in wonderland,</p>

      <h2>Silly me!</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Alice Key, April 16, 2012.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">LOL</span></h5><br>
      <p>Hey people! It's me, Alice! I was really scared last night after I read a really <strong>creepy</strong>
        story on this scary Website I always visit. What made it worse was that my parents were 
        away, so I was alone in the house. I switched on all the lights in my room and in the hall
        leading to the bathroom. That calmed me down a little. The only scary thing that happened 
        was when I finished showering and went back to my room. I switched on the light and, at that
        exact moment, my handbag fell off the chair. That made me jump! LOL

      <p>Today I was walking around the house when I fell outside and got a splinter in my finger. It hurt,
      but it reminded me of when I was younger and I used to go to the docks. I remember writing messages
      and stories there, but I don't <strong>remember</strong> where I hid them. I wish I could go back to those days!!

      <h5><span class="label label-success">life</span></h5><br>
      <p>Today I wrote a poem about why I love life! Here is how it goes:
      Life is fun. Life is cool. Laughing is honestly an impactful part of life. Things can grow. Things
      can die. Sometimes you may even cry. Life is sour, life is sweet. Life is a sourpatch kid.
      LOL, I think it's kind of silly, but oh well!!

      <p>Today I went out near the lake and sat near the fire pit. I felt like someone was watching me,
      but I think I was being just paranoid. I made some smores AND then thought back to easier days when
      I was a child. I loved coming out here all the time after going by the docks to dry off. Man, I miss it:(

      <p>OH MY GOODNESS! So tomorrow, PRETTY LITTLE LIARS IS FINALLY COMING BACK ON AIR! I am so
      hyped for Season 4! Personally, I think this show has been INSANE! Like, I don't want to spoil
      it for you guys, but all these twists and turns are making me crazy! Since all of the girls are
      so different I don't know who my favorite "liar" is! I really like Aria because she has the most
      real reactions to things. Spencer is smart as heck and is just...like wow don't get me started!
      Emily is so talented and nice and Hanna is silly but I love her personality and style! I guess from
      season three, I really like Hanna! She is slowly getting tougher and I love her and Caleb! I won't 
      post any spoilers incase you guys want to watch it, but other than that, I CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW!

      stop smiling while thinking about it! Beyond happy((:
